# Generating a Pull Request Description

This rule provides guidance for generating a pull request (PR) description in this repository.

## Where to Find the Template

The PR template is located at [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](mdc:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Always use this template as the basis for your PR descriptions.

## Best Practices

- **Preserve Markdown Structure:** Do not remove or alter required markdown sections, especially those used by automation (e.g., changelog entry details and comments).
- **Changelog Section:** The changelog section in the PR description must keep the markdown structure from the PR template exactly as-is, including all checkboxes, comments, and headings. Only the appropriate checkbox may be checked, and the changelog message must be placed under the `#### Comment` heading and before the closing `</details>` tag. Do not add, remove, or reformat any part of the changelog section except for checking the box and adding the message in the correct place.
- **Be Concise and Clear:** Summarize the changes, testing steps, and rationale in a way that is easy for reviewers to understand.
- **Remove Irrelevant Sections:** You may erase template sections that are not applicable to your PR, except for those required by automation.
- **Testing Instructions:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for how to test the changes.
- **Always Output Markdown:** When the user requests a PR description, always provide the output in markdown format, using the structure and sections from the PR template. The output should be copy-paste ready for a GitHub PR and must include all required sections unless the user specifies otherwise. Do not provide plain text or summaryâ€”always provide the markdown-formatted PR template filled out with the relevant details from the change, following these rules strictly.

## Example

See the PR template for the required structure and sections. When generating a PR description, ensure that all required checkboxes and markdown details are preserved for automation compatibility, and that the changelog message is placed under the `#### Comment` heading as specified above.
